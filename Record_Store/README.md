Record Store Project

A web app built using Ruby, PostgreSQL, Sinatra, HTML and CSS for a record store owner to view an inventory of stock.

User can view albums and artists in a variety of different ways including by searching an artists name, viewing all albums by an artist or viewing a specific album. User can also add a new artist to the database and add new stock of albums by that artist.

The inventory also displays the buy price, sell price, difference between the two and profit to be gained by selling all current stock of a particular album.
